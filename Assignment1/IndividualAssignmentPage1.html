        <h2>What is Genetic Engineering?</h2>
        <p>Genetic engineering is the field relating to the altering of an organisms genetic code 
            by inserting genes from a foreign source. There are many ways to go about this process 
            and a few will be explained throughout this website. It is a relatively new field with 
            a promising future with advancements in medicine, agriculture, breeding, and many more.

        <h2>Is Genetic Engineering Dangerous?</h2>
        <p>The potential for catastrophy when performing genetic engineering practices
            is somewhat high, depending on what it is you are engineering. In the <a href="IndAssignPage2.html">"History"</a> 
            section of this site, an experiment is outlined where Paul Berg was planning on 
            combining the DNA of a virus and a bacteria that could have created a "super" bacteria 
            that could have started an epidemic. There is also the fear of eventually 
            being able to create "designer babies" where parents will have the ability to pick 
            and choose every attribute that their baby would have. On the other hand, genetic disorders 
            could be a thing of the past by identifying diseases early on in pregnancy and replacing 
            potentially harmful genes with healthy ones. Also, farmers will be able to produce higher yields 
            and healthier foods. In conclusion, genetic engineering practices should be highly 
            regulated so that a catastrophy can never happen.
