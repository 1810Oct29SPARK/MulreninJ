            <h4>HIS EXPERIMENT</h4>
            <p>
                Paul Berg is known to be the father of recombinant-DNA technology. He is the 
                first person to experimentally create a strand of recombinant-DNA, a piece of 
                DNA that contains and expresses the genes from a foreign source. His experiment 
                consisted of splicing the DNA of the cancer causing bacterial virus, lambda, and 
                inserting it into the genome of the virus SV40. He used the restriction enzyme, ECO R1, 
                to splice both pieces of DNA at the same genomic sequence in each strand and combined 
                the two spliced strands to form a single piece of DNA that contained the genes of each 
                virus. His plan to then insert that piece of DNA back into the viral complex was never 
                actually completed.
            </p> <br>
            <h4>WHY HIS EXPERIMENT WAS NEVER COMPLETED</h4>
            <p>
                Public criticism was the main argument against his completing of the experiment. 
                When word got out that he was inserting DNA known to cause cancer into a virus that 
                normally attacks human cells, the public went crazy. They argued that if the virus 
                somehow escaped from the laboratory and began infecting humans, it cause a world-wide 
                epidemic. After listening to the public, Berg realized the potential danger of such 
                an experiment and decided to end his experiment at that point.

            <h4>WHY WAS THIS IMPORTANT</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>He showed that any two pieces of DNA could be combined using gene splicing</li>
                <li>The experiment highlighted the potential danger of such technology</li>
                <li>A myriad of companies formed after learning that this technology could be used for good</li>
                <li>Layed down some of the first ethical foundations for biotechnology</li>
            </ul>

                These scientists proved that the expression of genes of recombinant-DNA can be shown 
                in future generations of an organism. They inserted the genes from a kanamycin resistant 
                plasmid into the genome of a tetracycline resistant E. Coli. The E. Coli reproduced and dual 
                resistance to both tetracycline and kanamycin. They also showed that a gene from the South 
                African Clawed Frog could be inserted into the genome of E. Coli and be present in 
                future generations.

            <h4>Impact of Their Experiments</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Proved that genes can be inserted and replicated in bacterial host cells</li>
                <li>Potential for the mass production of higher animal proteins in bacteria</li>
                <li>Production of proteins less common in nature can be mass produced</li>
            </ol>

                Known as the first researchers to fully understand the CRISPR/Cas9 complex. 
                The CRISPR/Cas9 complex is a naturally occurring enzyme in bacteria that is used 
                as a defense mechanism to remove harmful viral DNA from the bacterial plasmid. 
                They discovered that they could engineer this enzyme to target any sequence of 
                DNA that they wanted. The engineered enzyme would contain a piece of sgRNA, which 
                consisted of trRNA that was used to anchor the template strand inside of the enzyme and 
                crRNA, which is used a comparator so that the enzyme can identify if the sequence of DNA 
                that it is supposed to cut is the correct sequence. This is the most common method of 
                genetic engineering done today due to the accuracy and adaptability of this enzyme.
