                    <p>
                        In August 2017, researchers at the Oregon Health & Science University successful 
                        edited the genomes of 12 fetuses who had the genomic sequence responsible for 
                        hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. HCM causes the heart to develop an abnormally thick 
                        heart muscle that could result in instant cardiac death and displays no symptoms. 
                        There is no cure, and affects 1 in 500 people worldwide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The scientists designed the CRISPR/Cas9 complex to target the specific sequence of 
                        DNA that causes HCM. The CRISPR enzyme was injected into the cells, and the sequence 
                        was removed and replaced with the healthy sequence in 72% of the fetuses. The experiment 
                        is yet another study done that confirms that CRISPR can be used to successfully edit 
                        the genomes of humans. The fetuses were never planted in mothers to form a legitimate 
                        baby but shows the possibilities available for future experiments aimed at removing and 
                        replacing harmful genes from human embryos.

                    <h2>Harvard University-"Mammophant"</h2>
                    <p>
                        Researcher George Church from Harvard University has successful inserted 45 wooly mammoth 
                        genes into the skin cells of elephants. The researches utilized CRISPR/Cas9 and other 
                        biotechnology to create the genes and insert them into the elephant cells. Genes associated 
                        with small ear, subcutaneous fat, hair, blood, and many others were successfully incorporated 
                        into the genomes of elephant skin cells. They will not be creating an entire wooly mammoth, but 
                        they say they want to create these mammoth-elephant hybrids within the next ten years once 
                        artifical wombs are able to take care of a fetus until it is ready to be born.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This type of research shows the possibility of one day being able to "de-extinct" species 
                        that once lived on Earth. There are many ethical consequences of such an experiment but 
                        researchers are justifying it by saying they are attempting to help elephants from colder 
                        climates better adjust to their environment.
